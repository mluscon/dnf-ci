DNF continuous integration support.

I created this project for our own purpose. On the other hand, I will be
happy if it becomes useful to someone else. Therefore, do not hesitate
to fork or contribute. The primary goal is to have everything simple,
perfect and flawless as much as possible. So, any feedback is welcome
and I hope that every contribution will keep the desired quality.
